# **Useful Tools I Would Suggest**

**Forewords: If you want to learn them efficiently, try to follow some video tutorials on Youtube !!!**


- **Inkscape** 
	Figure/Image editing, pipeline drawing etc.
	
- **Texmaker**
	Latex file editor. 
	One small skill: when you have independent .tex file for each chapter of your paper. Set the main file as master, then you can compile your file in any chapter .tex files. ![](imgs/20170505-155236.png)
